# Sentiment Analysis on Financial News Headlines
## NLP Using Neural Networks and Other Machine Learning Techniques
<br>
The purpose of this project is to start building a neural network model that can determine the sentiment of financial news headlines.  The users of this model would be investment firms who want to keep track of the market sentiment of a set of various products, companies, or industries.  <br><br>
With proper web scraping and feeding of new headlines, a firm would be able to keep track of various topics to make better informed investing decisions.  For example, one could feasibly keep track of terms that are rising rapidly in terms of positive sentiment in order to invest in them.<br><br>
The data is collected from Kaggle through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/ankurzing/sentiment-analysis-for-financial-news) .  It's a collection of 4,837 unique news headlines from various financial news sources. The headlines are split into three categories:
- positive
- neutral
- negative<br><br>

An example of a positive headline would be "With the new production plant the company would increase its capacity to meet the expected increase in demand and would improve the use of raw materials and therefore increase the production profitability."
<br>
While an example of a negative headline would be "The international electronic industry company Elcoteq has laid off tens of employees from its Tallinn facility ; contrary to earlier layoffs the company contracted the ranks of its office workers , the daily Postimees reported."
<br>
It's an interesting challenge that requires quite a bit of data manipulation to get the dataset to feed into a neural network.  By the end of this project, I hope to have a neural network that can not only correctly classify examples from the test set, but also work on a stream of new headlines streamed in from other sources.
